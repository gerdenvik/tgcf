You need to setup WSL-2 before you can run `tgcf` on Windows. You need to have Windows-11 or above for that.

Once you are done with that, open the Ubuntu Terminal and follow the steps in README.

Note: You can install python and run tgcf directly on Windows, but certain things may break. Consider this my aversion towards Windows.
